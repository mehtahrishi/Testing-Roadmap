# 🧪 My Software Testing Roadmap

This README outlines my learning and practice plan across **five key areas of software testing** that I am focusing on to build a strong QA skill set.

---

## 📌 Testing Domains I'm Learning:

1. ✅ Manual Testing  
2. 🤖 Automation Testing (Web)
3. 🌐 API Testing  
4. 📱 Mobile App Testing  
5. 📈 Performance Testing  

---

## ✅ 1. Manual Testing

**🔹 Purpose:**  
Manually test application functionality, UI, usability, and workflows to detect bugs without writing code.

**🔹 Tools & Concepts:**  
- Test Cases & Test Scenarios  
- Bug Reports  
- Test Plan & Test Strategy  
- Tools: JIRA, TestRail, TestLink  
- SDLC, STLC, Testing Types (Smoke, Regression, Functional, etc.)

**🔹 Python Required:**  
❌ No

---

## 🤖 2. Automation Testing (Web Apps)

**🔹 Purpose:**  
Automate repetitive UI tests for faster execution and higher test coverage.

**🔹 Tools & Tech:**  
- Selenium WebDriver (with Python)  
- PyTest (framework for organizing and running tests)  
- POM (Page Object Model) Design Pattern  
- BDD (optional): Behave for Gherkin-style tests  
- Allure (for reporting)

**🔹 Python Required:**  
✅ Yes  
**Basic Python is enough to start**, but learning functions, loops, conditions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) will help.

---

## 🌐 3. API Testing

**🔹 Purpose:**  
Test backend APIs to ensure correct data exchange, response time, and error handling.

**🔹 Tools & Tech:**  
- Manual Testing: **Postman** or Hoppscotch (Postwoman)  
- Automated Testing: Python + `requests` library + `pytest`  
- Understand REST APIs, HTTP methods, headers, JSON, status codes

**🔹 Python Required:**  
🔸 Optional (for automation only)  
**Postman alone is sufficient** for manual API testing.  
With basic Python, you can automate simple API test flows.

---

## 📱 4. Mobile App Testing

**🔹 Purpose:**  
Test Android/iOS apps for functionality, layout, gestures, and compatibility on real devices or emulators.

**🔹 Tools & Tech:**  
- **Appium** (Cross-platform automation, supports Python)  
- Android Emulator or Real Devices  
- Mobile testing scenarios: gestures, app installation, permission handling

**🔹 Python Required:**  
✅ Yes  
Appium supports Python — **basic Python is enough** to start automating mobile tests.

---

## 📈 5. Performance Testing

**🔹 Purpose:**  
Measure how well an application performs under load (speed, scalability, stability).

**🔹 Tools & Tech:**  
- **Apache JMeter** (UI-based tool for load and stress testing)  
- Alternative: **Locust** (Python-based load testing tool)  
- Key Concepts: Response Time, Throughput, Load, Stress, Spike Testing

**🔹 Python Required:**  
❌ No (if using JMeter)  
✅ Yes (only for Locust) — Basic Python is enough for writing simple Locust scripts.

## 🚀 Next Goals

- [ ] Build a Selenium + PyTest project for a sample website (Login/Test Form)
- [ ] Automate an API workflow using Postman and Python `requests`
- [ ] Create a simple Appium test for a mobile app (calculator, notes, etc.)
- [ ] Run a JMeter test simulating 100 users on a sample site
- [ ] Add all projects to GitHub as part of my QA portfolio

## 📚 Resources (Coming Soon)
I'll list tutorials, docs, and YouTube playlists I follow.
